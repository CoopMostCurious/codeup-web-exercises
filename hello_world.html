        <li>Anytime you add new work, make a <em>commit</em></li>
        <li>In IntelliJ, make a commit w/ <strong>Command+K</strong></li>
        <li>Add a "commit message" that explains what you're doing</li>
        <li>Hover over the "Commit" button and select "Commit and Push"</li>

    <h2>GitHub is very simple...</h2>
    <blockquote>It will allow a developer to <em>commit</em> (save) and then <em>push</em> (forward to a server) those changes.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>That server, curiously, is a Git server. It serves the git, if you will.</blockquote>
